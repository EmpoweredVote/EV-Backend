                "Nick Brown is Washington State\u2019s 19th Attorney General, elected into office in November 2024. Nick believes the Attorney General\u2019s role is to serve as the people\u2019s advocate, and is committed to using the legal tools and the power of the AG\u2019s Office to uphold and enforce Washington\u2019s laws, to protect people\u2019s rights, to stand up for our shared values, and to keep people safe.\\n\\nHaving grown up in Steilacoom, Nick is a proud product of public schools and the son of public servants: his dad was an Army veteran and his mom was a nurse and healthcare administrator. Determined to follow his parents\u2019 example, Nick joined ROTC to help pay for college, graduating from Morehouse and then going on to attain a law degree from Harvard University.\\n\\nNick then began his legal career in the Army JAG corps, where he gained experience as both a prosecutor and defense lawyer. He took on unscrupulous corporations and predatory lenders that were taking advantage of soldiers and their families, and defended the rights and liberties of young soldiers. Nick was awarded a Bronze Star in 2005.\\n\\nAfter the Army, Nick returned to Washington State where he worked as a prosecutor. He then went on to become the lead counsel for Governor Jay Inslee. During that time he learned how to make government work effectively on behalf of the public, and had the opportunity to work on a wide range of legal issues, including many focused on keeping people safe. At the governor\u2019s direction, Nick led the work to put a moratorium on the death penalty in Washington and then, during the first six months of the Trump Administration, Nick worked directly with the Governor and then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson in taking on the Trump\u2019s early unlawful actions, including his Muslim Ban.  \\n\\nLeaving the governor\u2019s office in 2017, Nick worked in the private sector, joining one of the premier law firms in the region. There, he helped public, private, and non-profit clients navigate complex civil litigation and constitutional issues. Part of his work involved Nick taking a lead role in defending landmark gun safety legislation from legal challenges.\\n\\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Nick to become the U.S. Attorney for Western Washington where he worked to fight drug cartels and sex trafficking, addressing the fentanyl crisis and reducing violent crime. He also chaired the Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Subcommittee on Civil Rights, and brought a focus to keeping every Washingtonians safe by preventing and prosecuting hate crimes and protecting the most vulnerable and members of marginalized communities. In 2023, Nick resigned from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to seek the office of Attorney General.\\n\\nAs Attorney General, Nick\u2019s focus is on getting results that benefit Washington State residents and tangibly improve their lives. His key areas of focus include protecting public safety, advancing environmental and worker protections, standing up for civil rights, and holding the powerful to account when they violate our laws and harm the people of our state.",

                "Steve Hobbs is Washington\u2019s 16th Secretary of State. He began his tenure in 2021 and was elected by the people of Washington in 2022. He is the first person of color to serve as Secretary of State and only the second in state history who was born in Washington.\\n\\nSecretary Hobbs leads one of Washington\u2019s most diverse state-government offices, which is responsible for managing state and local elections, corporation and charity filings, the Washington State Library, the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library, and the Washington State Archives. In addition, his office oversees the Combined Fund Drive for charitable giving by state employees, the Productivity Board state employee suggestion incentives program, and the Address Confidentiality Program to help protect survivors of crime.\\n\\nWhen Secretary Hobbs assumed office, he prioritized greater election security, countering misleading and harmful election disinformation, and expanded voter education and outreach. In addition, he pledged to preserve Washington\u2019s unique and rich history by enhancing Washington State Archives\u2019 and Washington State Library\u2019s capacity and ability to store and share state documents and other records.\\n\\nPrior to becoming Secretary of State, Hobbs was the state senator for Washington\u2019s 44th legislative district from 2006 to 2021. During his tenure, he served on numerous committees, including the Transportation Committee as chair. He adopted an expansive policy agenda that emphasized local job creation through helping small businesses and improving transportation infrastructure. In addition, he was dedicated to helping veterans and working with communities to create new and innovative approaches to strengthening education.\\n\\nSecretary Hobbs enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1987 as a private and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel with the Washington Army National Guard. He proudly served in Kosovo and Iraq, and was mobilized to command 750 service members during Washington\u2019s COVID-19 response. As state senator, he worked with service members to develop legislation ranging from help in education, finding good family-wage jobs, and protecting veterans\u2019 rights.\\n\\nRaised in a working-class family, Secretary Hobbs learned the value of hard work and education. He received an associate degree from Everett Community College and bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in political science and public administration, respectively, from the University of Washington.\\n\\nSecretary Hobbs is a proud husband and father. He married his wife Pam in 1995, and together they raised three boys: Gavin, Truman, and Winston.

                "Greg Nance proudly represents Kitsap as State Rep for Washington\u2019s 23rd Legislative District.\\n\\nThe son of a social worker and public defender, Greg learned the value of hard work growing up in a strong union household. As a teen, he worked various jobs as a landscaper, house painter, and firewood splitter. He attended Kitsap K-12 public schools and was a multi-sport athlete and debate champion at Bainbridge High where he won the state debate title in 2007, becoming one of five All-American debaters.\\n\\nAfter high school Greg was nominated by Congressman Jay Inslee to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point but chose instead to attend UChicago as a Truman Scholar. He earned his masters with a full ride scholarship at Cambridge University where he studied management and innovation as a Gates Scholar. Recognizing the impact of education on his own life, Greg made it a mission to pay it forward. In 2008 he co-founded Moneythink, a college-success nonprofit that was recognized by President Obama as a \u201cChampion of Change\u201d at the White House in 2012.\\n\\nDespite early successes, Greg battled depression and substance abuse. Now sober for over 12 years, he is on the Board of Kitsap Mental Health Services. He loves connecting with Kitsap kids to share lessons learned and can frequently be found speaking at local schools to share adventure stories like his 3,156-mile run from the Atlantic to the Pacific for youth mental health.\\n\\nGreg has been passionate about protecting Puget Sound since 1995, when he was inspired by a Suquamish Elder during a shoreline cleanup. He now represents Kitsap on the Citizen\u2019s Advisory Group for our region\u2019s salmon recovery council and is always looking for ways to connect Kitsap youth with opportunities to care for our environment.\\n\\nGreg grew up in Kitsap and is committed to delivering for neighbors across the peninsula. A lifelong ferry rider, Greg is on a mission to fix our ferries. He is also working to strengthen our schools, expand affordable childcare and reliable public transportation, bolster our healthcare workforce, fight fentanyl, and mobilize mental health.\\n\\nHe serves on the House Transportation Committee and was recently elected Vice Chair of the Legislature\u2019s Maritime Caucus. His colleagues also elected him Assistant Majority Whip where he\u2019s a member of the House Democrats Leadership.",

L&I's mission is to \"keep Washington safe and working.\" The agency administers many vital programs including the state's workers' compensation system and its occupational safety and health program.\\n\\nIn Joel's time as L&I director, an agencywide goal of helping injured workers heal and return to work with a particular emphasis on preventing long-term disability rates for injured workers is transforming the agency, resulting in better outcomes for workers and projected savings of more than 3 billion dollars.\\n\\nDuring his tenure, workers' compensation premium rates have remained flat, average costs in 2022 are almost identical to the costs in 2012. The agency has helped workers recover millions of dollars owed to them in wages through wage complaint investigations. Washington also remains a safe place to work, with one of the lowest workplace fatality rates in the country.\\n\\nJoel's position at L&I makes him one of 3 ex-officio members and he has served as both the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Washington State Investment Board (WSIB). He is currently the Chair of the Private Markets Committee and a member of the Audit and Administrative Committees.\\n\\nPreviously he worked at the state Employment Security Department for nearly 8 years, serving as Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner for the Budget, Policy, and Communication Division.\\n\\nBefore joining Employment Security, he was Deputy Director of Field Services at L&I.

                "Overcoming obstacles is a persistent theme in Tarra Simmons\u2019 life. Raised in Bremerton, Tarra had a difficult upbringing. Surrounded by trauma and violence at home, she dropped out of middle school at the age of 13 and was pregnant by 14. Despite giving birth to a son when she was 15 years old, Tarra managed to find her way back to school and became the first person in her family to graduate from high school. By 21 she had graduated from Pacific Lutheran University with a degree in nursing and embarked on a career as a registered nurse. However \u2013 as is often the case for people with adverse childhood experiences \u2013 Tarra suffered with behavioral health issues including substance use disorder. Rock bottom came in 2011 when she was sentenced to 30 months in prison.\\n\\nUpon leaving prison, Tarra found herself facing the challenges of re-entering society after incarceration. Despite her nursing degree, she was only able to find a job at Burger King. With her wages still being garnished to pay for court fees, she faced economic insecurity, housing instability, and a lack of employment options, all while trying to rebuild her relationship with her children. Despite these challenges, Tarra continued on her path to recovery and applied to law school so that she could impact change at a higher level. Having experienced the lows of opioid use disorder and been through a justice system that does everything it can to hold people down, she knew that the changes that she needed to make were systemic.\\n\\nAfter graduating from Seattle University with honors she received the prestigious Skadden fellowship, which supports talented lawyers in pursuing public interest law. Tarra focused her efforts on providing legal counsel to formerly incarcerated people so they could end their involvement with the criminal justice system. However, when the Washington State Bar refused to admit her because of her past, Tarra took a stand for everyone who has been incarcerated. She challenged the Bar all the way to the State Supreme Court, where she won a unanimous, same-day decision.\\n\\nSince then Tarra has continued working to help formerly incarcerated people re-integrate into society. She is the co-founder and director of the Civil Survival Project, a program housed under the Public Defender Association that provides legal services and advocacy for formerly incarcerated people. Gov. Jay Inslee appointed her to the Washington State Reentry Council where she served as co-chair for four years, as well as the Public Defense Advisory Board. She also serves as an advisory board member to the Washington Supreme Court Gender and Justice Commission and is on the board of the Economic Opportunity Institute.\\nTarra still lives in Bremerton with her partner, Eric, their three children (D\u00e9von, Dominic, and Madyson), and the family dog, Anna.\\n\\n",
